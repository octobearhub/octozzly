# Security Policy for Octozzly - Open-Source Decentralized Social Networking Platform

## 1. Secure Development Practices:
   1.1. All developers must follow secure coding practices and adhere to industry-standard guidelines for application development.
   1.2. Regular code reviews and security assessments should be conducted to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
   1.3. Third-party libraries and dependencies should be carefully evaluated for known security issues before integration into the codebase.

## 2. Authentication and Access Control:
   2.1. Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as password hashing, encryption, and salting, to protect user credentials.
   2.2. Use a role-based access control (RBAC) system to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive features and data.
   2.3. Employ secure session management techniques to prevent session hijacking or fixation attacks.

## 3. Data Privacy and Encryption:
   3.1. Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive user data, both in transit and at rest, using industry-standard encryption algorithms and protocols.
   3.2. Store user passwords using strong cryptographic hashing algorithms with salt to prevent unauthorized access.
   3.3. Follow privacy best practices, such as minimizing the collection and retention of personally identifiable information (PII).

## 4. Input Validation and Sanitization:
   4.1. Validate and sanitize all user inputs on the server-side to prevent common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
   4.2. Implement proper data validation and sanitization techniques on the client-side as an additional layer of defense.

## 5. Secure Communication:
   5.1. Utilize secure communication protocols (HTTPS) to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server.
   5.2. Implement secure token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) for API requests to ensure integrity and confidentiality.

## 6. Security Monitoring and Logging:
   6.1. Implement logging mechanisms to capture and store relevant security events and anomalies for auditing and investigation purposes.
   6.2. Utilize intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor and respond to potential security threats in real-time.

## 7. Regular Updates and Patching:
   7.1. Stay up to date with the latest security patches and updates for all used frameworks, libraries, and dependencies, including Spring, Maven, JavaScript, React, and Angular.
   7.2. Establish a process for promptly applying security patches to ensure the platform remains protected against known vulnerabilities.

## 8. Security Incident Response:
   8.1. Develop an incident response plan that outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a security breach or incident.
   8.2. Designate a responsible team or individual to handle security incidents, perform investigations, and coordinate necessary actions to mitigate risks and protect user data.

## 9. User Education and Awareness:
   9.1. Provide users with clear guidelines on best practices for securing their accounts, such as using strong passwords and enabling two-factor authentication.
   9.2. Educate users about potential risks and threats, such as phishing attacks, and provide tips for staying safe while using the platform.

## 10. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:
   10.1. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and ensure ongoing security improvements.
   10.2. Engage external security professionals to perform independent assessments and identify potential weaknesses.
